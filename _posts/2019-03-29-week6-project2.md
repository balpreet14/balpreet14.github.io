## Accomplishments:
* I have successfully created the 3d cup as a 3D design for the poster.
* I have created a 3D typography for the poster.
* I have used texture to make the poster look little retro, Even the cup design is little retro.

## Problems:
Overall in this project i haven't faced any major problem till now.But choosing gradient for each shape was bit of a work.

## Future work
In future i can use this to make logos.As 3D typography is a trend now so i can use it in future for making posters.I love working on Illustrator and i was fun doing it.

## Overall
The total work  was :
* To design a 3D typography and 3D design. 
* With retro theme Poster
### Work done:
Overall, i feel i have designed pretty much what i had in my mind.

## Summary
I designed 3D typography and design poster.I leraned to use tools like pathfinder, selection tool, direct selection tool, gradient tool, shape tool and pen tool in the software.I made it retro style because it is a latest trend in market.
But, I have recently came accross 3D design in Photoshop and i think it is a better tool for this purpose. The 3D text looks more realistic in photoshop.But, illustrator is a very good tool for a great start.In future i may try photoshop for this purpose.

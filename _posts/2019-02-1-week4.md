# [Adobe after effects mini project week4]({% post_url 2019-02-1-week4 %})
## Accomplishments:
I have created the background for the application.
I have created the animation for all the layers and combined all the layers in one composition
Then i have created a mp4 file from the composition.
Used the 3d layer tool to make the shadow.
In short, Finally,I completed my project in this week


## Problems:
Overall i wanted to use the puppet tool and the tranformations together.But it forms a unwanted outline over the character.Creating a 3d layer was difficult .As, the shadow was simple fill but then i have to change it's direction to make it look like a shadow.
Another problem was that, I was not able to render the video in mp4 format. so, i have to use the Media encoder tool to do the same.

## Future work
I can use it in future as a experience to learn more about adobe and can become a good animator/cartoon artist in future.

## Overall
The total work  was :
* movements of arms and legs.
* animated background
* rotation of the character(not sure about it)
But, I was unable to make the overall rotation of the charcter in 3d and use puppet tool.
Overall i think i was able to achieve maximum of it. Moreover, I used different effects, texts and 3d layers which i haven't decided it to use in my project earlier.

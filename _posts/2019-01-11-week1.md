## Adobe after effects ({% balpreet14.github.io/_posts/2019-01-11-week1.md %})
I will create an animated character in the adobe after effects. As,i have already designed some characters in my past project.
So,i wondered how my work will look in motion.That is why i decided to take a project in animation .it will have following:

* Animated background
* A character which have certain movements.
* Will use DUIk or puppet tool to get the end result
* The character will have movement of hands,legs,arms.

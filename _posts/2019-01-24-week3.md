## Accomplishments:
1.I have started working on the adobe after effects.
2.I learned the usage of keyframes.how to set the different parameters for the movement of my character.
3.The usage of puppet tool to place pins to move the character.
4.Way to clear the files from illustrator.As,illustrator produces empty files.
4.The usage of different pins like
 ** PIN STARCH TOOL: to stiffen the parts of image.
 ** PIN OVERLAP TOOL: To set the part of the image in front ,if two layers are overlapping.
5. Usage of rotation and position tool for moving the character.
6.To download the file.


## Problems:
My idea was to use puppet and tranformation tools together.But with that the character had unwanted outline over the character.which was a big problem.So, i had to make all animation by using tranform tools.

## Plan for next week
I will make a animated background for the character and add more movements to it.
## Overall
The total work is :
movements of arms and legs.
animated background
rotation of the character(not sure about it)

## [ Designing Trends 2019 mini project description week-3]({% post_url 2019-03-08-week3-project2 %})
## Accomplishments:
I designed the Coffee mug for the poster.I used gradient to make design look like 3D.I used basic tools like selector,shape tool and gradient to make the cup for the poster.
## Problems:
I haven't faced much problems till now as i am already pretty much familier with the software.But i do find it bit challenging to get exact gradient color combination.
## Plan for next week
* I will be refining the cup design. 
* Start working on the 3D typography for next week.
## Overall
* I have desiged the most part of the 3D design  and i am currently working on refining it more. 
* I will start working on typography and pattern for the poster.

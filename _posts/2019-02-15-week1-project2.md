### Project Description
I will work on 3D design and typography in this project.I have interest in typograpghy and the way how
a little change in font can change the whole mood of the logo and the website.
Moreover,I really got inspired by the work of Josu√© Menjivar.So, i thought of doing something in designing trends.

### Deliverables
* 3d typography 
* little innovation with the whole theme of the design
* I have to yet decide the whole theme of the design.
